**YTHoldForSpeed** allows you to quickly toggle between a selected video playback speed by tapping and holding on the video player in the YouTube application. There is also the option to automatically apply the selected speed when a new video player is launched.

This tweak was tested on various versions of the YouTube application released between 2020 and 2025 with the last known working version being **20.29.3**. The tweak has been tested on iOS 14.7.1 with checkra1n (root), iOS 15.1.1 as a sideloaded app, and iOS 15.7.5 / 16.4.1 with palera1n / Dopamine 2 (rootless). It is compatible with all devices on iOS 13 to iOS 18.
